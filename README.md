# awesome project name once we decide

An interactive collaborative community project inspired by wplace where you can draw and see your own pixel art on a map of the world. The only catch is you must be in or near the "pixel" that you want to colour! We've also implemented an augmented reality screen so you can see what art is above you - overlayed on the real world!

A web app designed to be used on your phone, _our project name here_ inspires you to go touch grass while collaborating with your community and making art.
