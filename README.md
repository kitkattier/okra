# MeowlPlace

An interactive collaborative community project inspired by WPlace where you can draw and view your own pixel art on a map of the world. The only catch is that you must be in or near the "pixel" that you want to colour! We've also implemented an augmented reality screen so you can see what art is above you - overlayed on the real world.

A web app designed to be used on your phone, MeowlPlace inspires you to go touch grass while collaborating with your community and making art!
